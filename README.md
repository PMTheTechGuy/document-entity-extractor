## 🛠 Local Development Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PMTheTechGuy/document-entity-extractor.git
cd document-entity-extractor
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your environment variables:

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Start the server locally:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
If you encounter an issue loading the application on `HTTP://localhost:8000`.

Quit the application using `Ctrl + C` and start the server on port `8001`.

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

## 🧠 OpenAI Key Setup (Optional for GPT Extraction)

This app supports two extraction modes:

- 🧠 GPT-enhanced extraction (more accurate, slower, uses OpenAI API)

- ⚡ Local spaCy model extraction (faster, free, no external API calls)

By default, the app will fall back to spaCy if no OpenAI key is provided and the `USE_GPT_EXTRACTION` is set to `False`.

### Setting Up OpenAI GPT Extraction (Optional)

*1. In your `.env` file, add your OpenAI API Key:*

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-real-openai-api-key-here
```
*2. Save the `.env` file.*

*3. Restart the FastAPI server:*

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

- ✅ If a key is provided, the app will automatically use GPT for extractions.
- ✅ If no key is provided or an API error occurs, the app will fall back to using spaCy.

---

## ⚙️ Controlling GPT Extraction Mode

In your `.env` file, you can control whether the app uses GPT or local spaCy extraction:
```
USE_GPT_EXTRACTION=True
```
- ✅ True → Use GPT extraction (requires valid OpenAI API key)

- ✅ False → Force local spaCy extraction, even if API key is present

Restart the server after changing the `.env` settings.
```
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The app will detect this automatically at runtime.
